# course-qa-manual

This course is based on [ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level, CTFL](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl-v4-0/) v4.0.1 from 2024. You can access it at [ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf](docs/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf).  
That course is mostly theoretical, but we add practical examples after each chapter and weekly assignments.
