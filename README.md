# course-qa-manual

This course is based on [ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf](docs/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf) from 2024. See the official site [ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level, CTFL](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl-v4-0/).

That course is mostly theoretical, but we add additionally:
- Practical examples for each chapter
- Weekly assignments
- Learn the basics of QA automation
- How to create test cases
- Use ChatGPT (or other LLMs) to:
  - Generate test cases based on requirements and specs
  - Generate the automation code based on a test case. Generated code can be in Python, Typescript, Rust, or any other language, even script files like bash or .bat
  - Give you some basic knowledge of Python, Typescript, and bash to understand the generated code and be able to make small changes to it
  - Basic usage of git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions
  - Integrate running automated tests in the CI pipeline like GitHub Actions
